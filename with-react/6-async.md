# A Functioning mock fetch form example
Here, a review of building a function UI that allows users to "search" for an arbitrary number of facts, so that they can learn food.  

**UI Elements**
- An input, where users can set a number of facts to fetch
- A list of facts
- a "loading facts" placeholder

**State & Logic**  
- a mock set of fact data
- a mock async fetch function which returns a promise after a set amount of time
